#### <u>APP Modules and packages MVC Files</u>

What have I learned?

There was a few things that were covered this week. These included architectural patterns, packages, modules, classes, and a reading on OOP (Object-oriented programming). As we are pretty far into the project, these topics weren't anything new too us. We have used modules/packages in many other tasks as well as using them in other languages such as JavaScript.

Modules/Packages/Libraries are very useful when it comes to performing tasks in any coding languages. These libraries are prewritten code that we can import to increase the overall productivity and optimize the tasks we are performing. The main benefit to using libraries is that it reduces the need to hard code certain tasks. For instance, we can use the module `pandas` to read through a CSV file and create a dataframe from the CSV data. This can be done with a single line of code. However, if we were to hard code this task, this would likely require far more time and lines of code. The idea is that we can use these code libraries to perform the task we like, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Below is some examples of how we import libraries:

OOP is an interesting topic to read up on as its use is has its opinions. A lot of people tend to hate OOP and prefer the functional programming approach. The thing with OOP is that it works really well when done right, but when done wrong can be pretty bad. Whereas, we can take more of a lazy approach with functional programming and still achieve the end goal. OOP tends to have these design patterns that we should follow when performing tasks such as creating classes where we should create constructors. These design patterns include such things as singleton, dependency injection, factory methods, inheritance, abstraction, and so on. Whereas, with functional programming, its just function after function. A key benefit of functional programming is that we can use functions to return values from inside another function. Other key benefits to functional programming is that we can avoid things such as constructors, getters and setters, this statements, inheritance, classes, and more. 

Like I mentioned previously, OOP can be a great way and often intuitive option when done correctly, but might not be the best solution for the given task. In my opinion I prefer the functional route as I tend to perform a lot of the same tasks in fewer lines, while reducing the overall complexity. In doing so, this usually increases the overall reusability of my code.

What do I know now, that I did not know before?

There wasn't really anything that was covered that we hadn't already done in the past
