What have I learned?

## Task one

Add a new menu method called "run_menu_two" that is executed when the top level menu item for Menu Two is selected. That method is to show a new menu using the same tuple format â€“ with different menu items.

```python
def run_menu_two(a_value):
    menu_two =  (\
                   "Select a number.",\
                   (1,"I am the first option",test_cmd),  \
                   (2,"I am the second option",test_cmd),   \
                   (3,"Quit",quit_cmd)\
                 )
    run_menu(menu_two)
    return True
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    menu_tuple = (\
                   "Select a number.",\
                   (1,"Menu One",run_menu_one),  \
                   (2,"Menu Two",run_menu_two),   \ #added the method here
                   (3,"Menu Three",test_cmd), \
                   (4,"Quit",quit_cmd)\
                 )
    run_menu(menu_tuple)
```

## Task Two

Change menu_example.py, replace menu_tuple with menu_list. Adjust all existing code to work with menus as lists.

```python
def run_menu_one(a_value):
    menu_one =  ["Select a number.",(1,"Menu Burger",test_cmd),  (2,"Menu Chips",test_cmd),   (3,"Quit",quit_cmd)] #Changed to list
    run_menu(menu_one)
    return True

def run_menu_two(a_value):
    menu_two =  ["Select a number.",(1,"I am option one",test_cmd),  (2,"I am option two",test_cmd),   (3,"Quit",quit_cmd)] #Changed to list
    run_menu(menu_two)
    return True


if __name__ == "__main__":
    menu_list = ["Select a number.",(1,"Menu One",run_menu_one),  (2,"Menu Two",run_menu_two),   (3,"Menu Three",test_cmd), (4,"Quit",quit_cmd)] #Changed to list
    run_menu(menu_list)
```

## Text based adventure game

```python
import random

items = []


def chest(score):
    random_Number = random.randint(10, 1000)
    score = score + random_Number
    randItem = random.sample(
        {'Sword', 'gold', 'diamond', 'shield', 'food'}, 1)
    print("you have found a chest")
    print("Press enter to open the chess")
    inputType = input()
    print(f"Congratulations. You have found: {randItem}")
    items.append(randItem)
    print("Your score is:" + f" {score}")


def set_Location(location):
    return (f"Your location is: {location}")


def get_Input():
    return input()


def fight():
    random_Number = random.randint(1, 5)
    print("Oh no, a rouge skeleton has appeared")
    print("Type a number between 1 and 5 to kill the skeleton")
    print(random_Number)
    if(get_Input() == random_Number):
        print("You have killed the skeleton")
        return 1
    else:
        print("You have died")
        return 0


def main():
    score = 0
    print(set_Location("The Shire"))
    print("Type left to go to the castle, right to go too the cave")
    if (get_Input() == "left"):
        print(set_Location("Castle"))
        print("Type left to go to up the spiral stairs, right to go down to the catacombs")

        if (get_Input() == "left"):
            print(set_Location("Castle Spire"))
            chest(score)
            get_Input()
            print("Heading back down...")
            print("Type left to leave the castle or right to go down to the catacombs")
            if (get_Input() == "left"):
                print(
                    "Type left to go to the distant village, right to enter the dark thicket, or forward to the beach")
                if (get_Input() == "left"):
                    print(set_Location("Village"))
                elif (get_Input() == "forward"):
                    print(set_Location("Beach"))
                elif (get_Input() == "right"):
                    print(set_Location("Dark Thicket"))
            else:
                print(set_Location("Catacombs"))
                if(fight()):
                    chest(score)
                else:
                    return
        else:
            print(set_Location("Catacombs"))
            if(fight()):
                chest(score)
            else:
                return
    else:
        set_Location("Cave")
        get_Input()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    """ This is executed when run from the command line """
    main()
